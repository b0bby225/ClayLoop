# ClayLoop

**Clay pigeon / skeet shooting controller for Flipper Zero Sub-GHz signals**

Queue up to 4 `.sub` files and transmit them in sequence with configurable delay, duration, interval, and repeat count. Features LED/beep countdown, vibration feedback, mid-countdown cancellation, and persistent per-group file path memory.

## Features

- **Multi-file queue** - Select 1-4 `.sub` files, transmitted in order
- **Configurable timing** - Duration (0.5-30s), interval (0-60s), start delay (None, 1-10s)
- **Repeat control** - 1-16 fixed cycles or infinite loop
- **LED countdown** - Red (440Hz) / Yellow (660Hz) / Green (880Hz) flash sequence with vibration before each TX
- **TX feedback** - Purple LED during active transmission, 1000Hz start beep
- **Mid-cancel** - Press OK during any countdown gap to abort immediately
- **Protocol support** - Both RAW and keyed protocol `.sub` files (Princeton, MegaCode, etc.)
- **Persistent settings** - All parameters + per-group file paths saved to SD card
- **Per-group path memory** - File browser remembers paths independently for each file count group (1/2/3/4 files)
- **Reset combo** - Up+Left on delay screen resets all settings and saved paths to defaults
- **13-frame animation** - Animated clay pigeon silhouette on right half of display

## Screens

| Screen | Controls |
|--------|----------|
| **Delay** | Left/Right = start delay, OK = proceed, Back = exit |
| **Setup** | Left/Right = repeats, Up/Down = file count, OK = proceed |
| **Control** | Left/Right = duration, Up/Down = interval, OK = start/stop |

- **Back (short)** returns to previous screen
- **Back (long)** exits the application
- **Up+Left** on delay screen opens reset confirmation
